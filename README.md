##The idea is to:
Detect malware using:
*Generic Algorithm based intrusion detection: GA-IDS
*File extension
*Threat intelligence cloud
*Encrypted Unique Bin identifiers co-joined with GA-IDS

##Prevention:
If we can identify them we can analyze them in real time to prevent them by immobilizing them completely using DatashiledAI encryption.
